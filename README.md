# How to make a GIF

Slides from "How to make a GIF" Lunch &amp; Lightning talk ⚡️

If you didn't actually see this talk, the slides might not make much sense on their own. In that case, I recommend checking out my post [GIF-ted: from video to GIF in PhotoShop](https://maraaverick.rbind.io/2017/07/gif-ted-from-video-to-gif-in-photoshop/) in which I cover much of the same material.

In the PDF, all GIFs can be seen by clicking on the still images.
